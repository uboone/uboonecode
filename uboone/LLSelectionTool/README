This is a temporary copy of SelectionTool repository. The original can be found here:

https://github.com/larlight/larlite/tree/trunk/UserDev/SelectionTool

... except currently only imports: OpT0Finder
Taken from the tag ups_v04_36_00.

*) No modification to the code under this temporary copy (directory uboonecode/uboone/LLSelectionTool) 
is allowed except an import from the original github repository shown above based on a tagged release.
Addition/modification to the original repository can be done at any time however one should note some 
packages require passing of a unit test.

*) This repository is meant to disappear once we release various packages via ups. Any code written that 
uses this directory must expect a transition and users must accompany it smoothly. It is code user's 
responsibility to do so (i.e. code carefully, do not hack in #include and lib dependency)
